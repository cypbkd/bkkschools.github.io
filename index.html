            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a father of two, my older daughter is about 5 so I started house hunting to find a good school.
                The school ratings on the real estate website are not comprehensive,
                so I built this table to cover more ratings from all popular ratings websites including greatschools,
                schooldigger and niche.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the records are manually added over time as I research houses. Not all schools are covered as
                they may not in my research area. Please feel free to <a class="text-muted" href="submit.html">submit missing records</a>,
                it will help others as well.
